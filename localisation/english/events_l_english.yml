dr.11.t:0 "Question Of Austria"
dr.11.d:0 "Ever since the Schlimkrieg, the Austrian people have resided in a weak, and unstable nation. Within the past several years we've already pursued closer bonds with Austria, along with Hungry, in an economic association between our governments.\n\nWith the rising Davidian power, the question now is how should we continue our policy on Austria going forward?\n\n1. We can progressively retract our business with Austria in favor of strengthening our alliance with the Davidians. This decision will ensure that Austria is inevitably annexed.\n\n2. We can double down on our Austrian ties, and guarantee their independence in the event of potential conflict. This decision will eventually allow us to either establish a full military alliance between our nations, or turn them into a satellite state, however this will surely lead to trouble with the Davidians."
