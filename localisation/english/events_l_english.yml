dr.10.t:0 "Davidian Demands For Czechoslovakia"
dr.11.t:0 "Question Of Austria"
dr.11.d:0 "Ever since the Schlimkrieg, the Austrian people have resided in a weak, and unstable nation. Within the past several years we've already pursued closer bonds with Austria, along with Hungry, in an economic association between our governments.\n\nWith the rising Davidian power, the question now is how should we continue our policy on Austria going forward?\n\n1. We can progressively retract our business with Austria in favor of strengthening our alliance with the Davidians. This decision will ensure that Austria is inevitably annexed.\n\n2. We can double down on our Austrian ties, and guarantee their independence in the event of potential conflict. This decision will eventually allow us to either establish a full military alliance between our nations, or turn them into a satellite state, however this will surely lead to trouble with the Davidians."
dr.11.a:0 "Austria isn't our domain."
dr.11.b:0 "Austria must be protected!"

dr.13.t:0 "Annexation Of Czechoslovakia"
dr.13.d:0 "The Czechoslovak government has surrendered their sovereignty to us. We will annex the historic Bohemian region, and will offer Slovakia to the Hungrians. Unfortunately there is a high likelihood that the Polshkans will interfere in these arrangements and will seek to claim their own share of the territory. Regardless, this is a victory for us."
dr.13.a:0 "Bye bye, Czechoslovakia."
dr.14.t:0 "Czechoslovakia Defiant"

dr.15.t:0 "Davidians Propose Commercial Agreement"
dr.15.d:0 "In an attempt to foster increased commercial and trade relations between our two nations, the Davidians have brought to us a proposal. This agreement, if initiated, would entail that we begin importing Davidian coal in exchange for assistance of our economic & industrial development. If we are to approve of this agreement it may even allow for us to help build the foundations of a European Economic Community. The question now is whether we'd be obligated to keep our end of the bargain."

The time has come for us to reevaluate our current path going forward. No longer shall the French people be humiliated! It's about time that we assert our dominance on the European, and global stage. In order to achieve this goal we shall endorse..."

dr.27.t:0 "Romania Defiant"

dr.28.a:0 "Da, comrades!"
dr.29.t:0 "Connerians Deny Our Request"
dr.29.d:0 "The Connerians have denied our request to join the Connertern. It seems these revisionists have denied us on the basis of our practice of vanguardism, which differs in some regards to theirs. The only path forward is our own counter-revolution! Death to the Third Internationale, long live the Fourth!"
dr.29.a:0 "You'll rue the day you made this choice."
dr.30.t:0 "[XSM.GetName] Occupies Xinjiang"
dr.30.d:0 "While our invasion of Turkestan progresses, the [XSM.GetName] has seized the moment to move in and occupy Turkestan's Xinjiang province. The utter audacity of this move is incredible, and should no doubt provoke some kind of response from us. We have three options:\n\n1. We could let it slide completely, and just let them have the territory. Perhaps Conner and Ma Bufang could even enjoy lunch together once our invasion concludes.\n\n2. We could demand compensation for this loss, through forcing them to demilitarize the territory, and giving us resource rights to what little can be excavated from the Kashgar region, in western Xinjiang.\n\n3. We could seize the territory through force and annex it for ourselves. This option would also give us a foothold in western China.\n\nNo matter how we decide to handle the situation, the [XSM.GetName] will be forced to comply, regardless of our terms."
dr.30.a:0 "Let it slide."
dr.30.b:0 "Demand Compensation."
dr.30.c:0 "Seize what is ours."

dr.32.t:0 "Japan Decolonizes"
dr.32.d:0 "Japan's newly democratic government has issued an order for military garrisons to evacuate former imperial territories by the decree of President Dillon. This political move serves to distance the country from it's imperialist past, and to establish new ties with the free nations of East Asia. Rather than conquering Asia through brute force it seems the Japanese are more so interested in uniting the region diplomatically."
dr.32.a:0 "Has the rising sun finally set?"
dr.33.t:0 "Air Raids Over Ethiopia"
dr.33.d:0 "In recent news, Italy has conducted a series of air raids over Ethiopian territory. Analysts of the event predict this to be a move to instigate war for a third Italian invasion of the country. Interestingly, select regions in the Horn of Africa weren't targeted, likely due to the Italian government scheming alongside the local groups in these areas to assist in Ethiopia's subjugation. It is highly likely that these course of events will result in all out war between these two Empires vying for control over East Africa."
dr.33.a:0 "How will the situation escalate further?"

dr.35.t:0 "David-Conner Pact"
dr.35.d:0 "We've been approached by the Davidian delegation in regards to signing a pact of non-aggression and cooperation. This arrangement would allow for us to both pursue our goals of subjguating Eastern Europe. While ratifying this document would definitely lead to a temporary cooperation between our governments, there is no guarantee that the Davidians won't eventually decide to march East."
dr.35.a:0 "Sign away!"
dr.35.b:0 "We don't agree to your terms."
dr.36.t:0 "David-Conner Pact - Connerians Accept"
dr.36.d:0 "The Connerians have decided to ratify a pact for our two governments' mutual cooperation and non-aggression. This arrangment will temporarily ensure we won't have to fight a war with the [SOV.GetName] before we're prepared for it."
dr.36.a:0 "Wundebar!"
dr.37.t:0 "David-Conner Pact - Connerians Decline"
dr.37.d:0 "The Connerians have decided to deny our offer for a pact of mutual cooperation and non-aggression. Due to their unwillingness to sign this pact we won't offer them any territory that we conquer in Polshka."
dr.37.a:0 "Damn you!"
dr.38.t:0 "Davidians Demands Our Territory"
dr.38.d:0 "In a recent telegram directly from Berschlim, we have been told that the Davidian government is demanding that we cede their former territories! How shall we respond to this absolutely outrageous request?"
dr.38.a:0 "Poland is not yet lost!"
dr.38.b:0 "We have no choice..."
dr.39.t:0 "Polshka Accepts Our Demands"
dr.39.d:0 "The Polshkans have submitted to our will, and are willing to cede our former territories back into the Reich."
dr.39.a:0 "A mighty victory for the [GER.GetAdjective] nation."
dr.40.t:0 "Polshka Denies Our Demands"
dr.40.d:0 "The Polshkans are resilient in their denial of any territorial concessions to us. We gave them the opportunity for peace, but now that is out of the question."
dr.40.a:0 "War it is!"
dr.41.t:0 "Respecting The David-Conner Pact"
dr.41.d:0 "After our successful invasion of Polshka it is now our responsibility to dictate whether we'll continue to respect our pact with the Connerians. Granting the territories of Bialystok, Lwow, and Stanislawow, to the [SOV.GetName] will satiate their desire to obtain these territories. If we are to deny granting these territories, the Connerians will undeniably break the pact and will pursue us through bloodshed."
dr.41.a:0 "Respect the pact."
dr.41.b:0 "Keep our gains."
dr.42.t:0 "Japan Proposes An Alliance"
dr.42.d:0 "The Japanese government has reached out to us and have proposed an alliance between our two nations, called the Alliance of Free Nations. Allying with Japan may be a great means of securing our influence, along with the regional stability, of East Asia and the Pacific. Our response to this offer is..."
dr.42.a:0 "America and Japan, stand hand in hand."
dr.42.b:0 "MMMOOVE!"
dr.43.t:0 "Fate Of East Africa"
dr.43.d:0 "Now that we and our allies have finally triumphed over the Ethiopian lion, we must now decide what to do with the territory.\n\n1. We could fully annex the territory, and integrate it into our existing colonial empire.\n\n2. We could establish an East African colony that will serve to extract resources from the region for our benefit.\n\n3. We could subjugate the region into smaller fiefdoms that will serve our interests in building allies on the African continent."
dr.43.a:0 "Annex the territory."
dr.43.b:0 "Establish a colony."
dr.43.c:0 "Subjugate them."
dr.44.t:0 "Japan Returns Vladivostok"
dr.44.d:0 "After our peace negotiations with Japanese diplomats, they've offered to return the city of Vladivostok, and surrounding territory, to us."
dr.44.a:0 "Thank you!"

dr.45.t:0 "Alliance Of Free Nations"
  dr.45.d:0 "Japanese delegation have come to us seeking a military alliance they've dubbed the "Alliance of Free Nations."
dr.45.a:0 "Accept the alliance."
dr.45.b:0 "We're not interested."

dr.47.t:0 "Davidians Pursue Daveschluss"
dr.47.d:0 "The Davidians are currently pursuing the annexation of Austria in an event they've dubbed as 'Daveschluss'; the union of the two countries. There are several options we can choose to handle the situation.\n\n1. We could revoke our guarantee of Austria's independence, and allow for Davidian troops to enter the country.\n\n2. We could demand resource rights to the Austrian territory we claim.\n\n3. We could demand our claimed Austrian territory is handed over to us in the aftermath of the annexation.\n\n4. We could double down on our support for Austria, which may prompt the Davidians to declare war."
dr.47.a:0 "Permit the annexation."
dr.47.b:0 "We want resource compensation!"
dr.47.c:0 "We want territorial compensation!"
dr.47.e:0 "There will be no Daveschluss!"
dr.48.t:0 "Japan Withdraws"
dr.48.d:0 "Due to the change in government in Tokyo, Japan has abandoned its colonial holdings. From this point onwards we are a free nation able to dictate our own affairs."
dr.48.a:0 "What could this mean for the future?"

dr.51.t:0 "Convening The Party"
dr.51.d:0 "Another year has passed for the [SOV.GetName], and now we must determine what path our country should pursue going forward. Should we continue Conner's current vision for the nation, or perhaps align with a new sect of Marxist theory? The time is now for us to decide between the vanguardist and utopianist factions within our country. Regardless of which option we choose, it's undeniable that it will have ramifications beyond what the mind can even imagine, for not only Russia, but the world."
dr.51.a:0 "§RVanguardists"
dr.51.b:0 "§OUtopianists"
dr.52.t:0 "The Soviets Rise Up"
dr.52.d:0 "By no means has James' transition to power been smooth sailing, which is the very issue he faces now. The discontent, starved non-Russian peoples have lined up in the streets across the union's many population centers, and have begun protesting their staunch disagreement with the change in leadership. While most ethnically Russian-predominant regions of the country have shown their allegiance to the CVPR, regardless of leadership, new soviets have popped up all across the minority areas of the union. These local governments have begun to unite against the central rule in Ramscow, and have formed their own nationwide coalition against our regime. There is no hope for them though. We will crush these revisionists under a fist smeared with blood, tears, and iron."
dr.52.a:0 "Death to traitors!"

dr.53.t:0 "Connerians Offer An Alliance"
  dr.53.d:0 "The Connerian government have graciously approached us with an offer for non-aggression."
dr.53.a:0 "A closer relationship would mutually benefit us."
dr.53.b:0 "We don't negotiate with communists."

dr.56.t:0 "Partitioning Mongolia"
dr.56.d:0 "As we continue the reclamation of our rightful lands we've finally reached the gates of the Far East, at the borders of the Mongol khanate. The time has come to decide how Mongolia is to be conquered, and there are three prominent solutions.\n\n1. The safest option for our diplomatic reputation is to firstly approach the Japanese before considering how Mongolia should be divided. While this is indeed the ideal route, there are some hurdles that may come with it; i.e. Japan's demands. There is a possibility they'll keep out of Mongolian affairs, however there's also an even greater chance that some sort of concessions must be granted.\n\n2. The second option available to us is to simply seize the regions we hold claim to, while setting up a Mongolian satellite state as a buffer between us and the Japanese. It should be considered that Japan might still retain interest in the region in the forseeable future, as this solution would mean providing them with no compensation for the loss of a potential Mongol ally.\n\n3. Finally, there is the most extreme of the three solutions; outright annexing all of Mongolia. This would be viewed as a fairly aggressive move by other countries, especially those in East Asia. Like the previous option, there is still a likelihood that Japan may eventually provoke us over the status of the region."
dr.56.a:0 "Approach the Japanese."
dr.56.b:0 "Take our core territories, and establish a satellite state."
dr.56.c:0 "Seize it all!"
dr.57.t:0 "Partitioning Mongolia - Connerians Approach Us"
dr.57.d:0 "The Connerians have sent us an offer to dictate the fate of Mongolia, as their conquests towards the Far East continues. With this offer we now have a seat at the negotiation table to either address our neutrality in the affair, or demand our own concessions from them. There are four notable approaches to this that we may consider.\n\n1. We could exclude ourselves from Mongolian affairs, and let their fate be determined entirely by the Connerians. This decision may prove unpopular amongst our core population, however it may be necessary in order to facilitate continued peace between our countries.\n\n2. The next option we have is to demand the annexation of the Hulunbuir province to [MAN.GetName], and the establishment of a Mongol puppet state in the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. This option would satisfy both our countries' desires, as the Connerians would be granted their claimed territories, along with overlordship of Mongolia proper. For the sake of preserving peace this is the most ideal solution to our mutual benefit.\n\n3. A more radical solution would be the annexation of Mongolia proper into a puppet state of ours, and of course with Hulunbuir being seized by [MAN.GetName] too. This would grant the Connerians their claimed territories, but zero jurisdiction over Mongol affairs.\n\n4. Lastly, the most extreme and one-sided of our options, we demand all territory currently controlled by the Mongol khanate be annexed into our Mongol subject. This would grant absolutely zero concessions to the Connerians. Despite this arrangement most likely provoking the Connerians to pursue solving the issue through bloodshed instead of diplomacy, if they are to accept this solution we'll also get an option to establish new subjects, rather than a single one."
dr.57.a:0 "Mongolia is not our domain."

They are currently engaging in guerrilla tactics within both the urban and rural areas of Catalonia, and are generally proving to be a nuissance for our administration. We're now faced with the issue of tackling this insurrection. Our two options are to either temporarily issue an increased police prescence in and around Barcelona, or we could escalate the conflict into a full-on war between our forces, and those of the anarchists. Needless to say, this latter option would both destabilize our position and drag us into the dreaded Iberian conflict, however it could prove a worthwhile investment in securing the Iberian peninsula for ourselves in the future."

Lastly, there is the most extreme of the two solutions; outright annexing all of Mongolia. This would be viewed as a fairly aggressive move by other countries, especially those in East Asia. Like the previous option, there is still a likelihood that Japan may eventually provoke us over the status of the region."

dr.143.d:0 "After offering the Japanese a position to negotiate Mongolia's fate they've decided to demand only minor concessions. Agreeing to this solution would grant [MAN.GetName] the Hulunbuir province, and would establish a new Japanese-Mongol puppet state in the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. While we must grant compensation to the Japanese with this arrangement they're giving us the greenlight to seize our claimed territory, along with establishing a Mongol satellite state.\n\nIf we disagree with the negotiations, however, we could choose to resolve the affair through war. This may potentially grant us more than we would've gotten otherwise, though there's a fairly high likelihood this may drag us into a war with Japan."

dr.145.d:0 "After offering the Japanese a position to negotiate Mongolia's fate they've decided to demand all of Mongolia's controlled territory. Agreeing to this solution would grant [MAN.GetName] the Hulunbuir province, and would establish a new Japanese-Mongol puppet state in Mongolia proper. Alternatively, they could establish even more subjects in the newly occupied region too. While we must grant compensation to the Japanese with this arrangement they're allowing us to retain our claims, but with no actual territorial gains.\n\nIf we disagree with the negotiations, however, we could choose to resolve the affair through war.

dr.146.d:0 "Despite how outrageous our demands are, the Connerians have decided to give in and are letting us have complete jurisdiction over all of Mongolia. Regardless of how we handle the situation going forward we'll allow for them to keep their claims over the respective lands at the very least. To finally end these negotiations we have two solutions for the Mongol territories; either establish a Mongol puppet encompassing all of the territory, or divide the region among Mongol, Tuvan, and Buryat subjects."
dr.146.a:0 "A single Mongolia."
dr.146.b:0 "Divide the territory."

dr.147.d:0 "The Connerians have denied our, fairly outrageous, demands for all Mongolian-controlled territories. They've decided to leave the negotiations, and are preparing to launch an invasion in order to secure their claims and influence in the region. We should announce our guarantee of Mongolia's independence to not seem weak, and not to associate ourselves as the aggressor of such a conflict, however there's no sure sign that this move would stop them from going in."
dr.147.a:0 "Guarantee Mongolia."
