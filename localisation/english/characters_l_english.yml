leader_desc_david:0 "§HDavid Joseph "Peanut" Simlick§!\n\nDavid began his military training, in 1850. He quickly rose to the top of his class - proving to be a capable fighter and strategist. David would show off his prowess to invading Danish forces. For his efforts during the war he'd be promoted to colonel within the Prussian army. A year after the conflict's conclusion another war would arise between Prussia and France. David would then be adopt the title 'von Schlim', and would be elevated to Generalfeldmarschall by the Prussian high army command. Under David's guise the Prussian forces managed to halt the French advance. Eventually France would be forced to make peace with Prussia in 1856. This treaty would see the annexation of most German states into a single, unified empire. The Franco-Prussian War proved to David that he was beloved by the German people for his valiant efforts. He grew power hungry in his position and began dreaming of a new Reich; a David Reich. For the time being, however, David would be forced to maintain cordial relations with the Kaiser. In 1862, Otto von Bismarck became the German chancellor. David would become an advisor to him, however their relationship would be strained due to some of Bismarck's views on the Polish populations in Germany, though they'd find agreement on other things such as religious policy. David was furious when Kaiser Wilhelm II decides to dismiss Bismarck from his post. The Franco-German War began in 1890, and the Germans would prove to initially be massively successful. David's forces would eventually be stopped at the gates of Paris by Haskell. David urgently demands that Wilhelm puts an end to the war, which is accepted. Years later, he would institute a strengthening of his grip over his forces due to the spread of radical ideas within the ranks.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Schlimkrieg, David would focus exclusively on the Western front against France. During the reestablishment of Poland, David would demand that the annexation and subsequent Germanization of Polish territories be denied. Wilhelm II would request that David come up with a way to break the Russian fighting spirit. He met with Conner in exile, and David would offer his return to Russia in order to ferment chaos. In 1919, David negotiates the Treaty of Boob-Lickcocks with Russia. Germany's final hope of winning in the West would be the Daveschlacht; a last ditch series of offensives into French territory, which became the largest human wave offensive in history. The Schlimkrieg ends with a loss for the Central Powers and the collapse of Germany in its entirety.\n\nDavid would retire from his army position, move to Berlin, and would pursue politics. In late 1922, he'd release his ideological manifesto, "Mein Cumph". This novel would outline the very ideals and philosophies of his new sociopolticial ideology, Davidism. The weak state of the democratic government in Prussia allowed David to capitalize on the situation years after, as he'd launch a putsch on March 1st, 1927, his birthday. David would then proclaim himself 'Schlimfuhrer' of the newly born David Reich. The mental state of the Schlimfuhrer would only deteriorate further as he'd become further engrossed him his ideology. David would deliver the great Davesden Address on his birthday in 1935. Only time will tell for the fate of the Davidian peoples."
