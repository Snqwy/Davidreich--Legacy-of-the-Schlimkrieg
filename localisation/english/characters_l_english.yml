leader_desc_david:0 "§HDavid Joseph "Peanut" Simlick§!\n\nDavid began his military training in 1850. He quickly rose to the top of his class - proving to be a capable fighter and strategist. David would show off his prowess to invading Danish forces. For his efforts during the war he'd be promoted to colonel within the Prussian army. A year after the conflict's conclusion another war would arise between Prussia and France. David would then be adopt the title 'von Schlim', and would be elevated to Generalfeldmarschall by the Prussian high army command. Under David's guise the Prussian forces managed to halt the French advance. Eventually France would be forced to make peace with Prussia in 1856. This treaty would see the annexation of most German states into a single, unified empire. The Franco-Prussian War proved to David that he was beloved by the German people for his valiant efforts. He grew power hungry in his position and began dreaming of a new Reich; a David Reich. For the time being, however, David would be forced to maintain cordial relations with the Kaiser. In 1862, Otto von Bismarck became the German chancellor. David would become an advisor to him, however their relationship would be strained due to some of Bismarck's views on the Polish populations in Germany, though they'd find agreement on other things such as religious policy. David was furious when Kaiser Wilhelm II decides to dismiss Bismarck from his post. The Franco-German War began in 1890, and the Germans would prove to initially be massively successful. David's forces would eventually be stopped at the gates of Paris by Haskell. David urgently demands that Wilhelm puts an end to the war, which is accepted. Years later, he would institute a strengthening of his grip over his forces due to the spread of radical ideas within the ranks.\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Schlimkrieg, David would focus exclusively on the Western front against France. During the reestablishment of Poland, David would demand that the annexation and subsequent Germanization of Polish territories be denied. Wilhelm II would request that David come up with a way to break the Russian fighting spirit. He met with Conner in exile, and David would offer his return to Russia in order to ferment chaos. In 1919, David negotiates the Treaty of Boob-Lickcocks with Russia. Germany's final hope of winning in the West would be the Daveschlacht; a last ditch series of offensives into French territory, which became the largest human wave offensive in history. The Schlimkrieg ends with a loss for the Central Powers and the collapse of Germany in its entirety.\n\nDavid would retire from his army position, move to Berlin, and would pursue politics. In late 1922, he'd release his ideological manifesto, "Mein Cumph". This novel would outline the very ideals and philosophies of his new sociopolticial ideology, Davidism. The weak state of the democratic government in Prussia allowed David to capitalize on the situation years after, as he'd launch a putsch on March 1st, 1927, his birthday. David would then proclaim himself 'Schlimfuhrer' of the newly born David Reich. The mental state of the Schlimfuhrer would only deteriorate further as he'd become further engrossed him his ideology. David would deliver the great Davesden Address on his birthday in 1935. Only time will tell for the fate of the Davidian peoples."
leader_desc_conner:0 "§HConner Lennon Ramsdell§!\n\nConner began his political endeavors in the year 1891, in Yekaterinburg. There he would establish the CVPR (Conner's Vanguard of the People's Revolution), a communist organization that would begin their revolutionary activities in Ukraine and Russia proper. Conner assassinates Tsar Alexander III himself, and would subsequently flee the country from Siberia to avoid either arrest or execution. For roughly the next thirteen years, Conner would roam all across the world; from Asia, to Europe, Africa, Oceania, then North America, until he'd eventually be caught and extradited back to Russia in 1908. His time venturing across the world would grand him the status of an international criminal, even being nicknamed "The Red Walker". During his six years of imprisonment, Conner would gradually grow ever more mentally unstable.\n\nThe chaos in Russia, brought upon by the Schlimkrieg, would allow for members of the CVPR to break their leader out of prison and send him into exile in the Alpine mountains. In 1917, Conner would be approached by David with a request to ferment revolution in Russia to take them out of the war. Seeing his chance he'd return to Russia, but would be greatly dismayed to discover that a liberal revolution had already taken place, with an unstable coalition government of various socialist and non-socialist factions being brought into power. Not long after Russia's withdrawl from the Schlimkrieg, the murders of the Romanov royal family, and the advent of the Third Internationale, vanguardist forces would prompt the White factions of the army into conflict by successfully seizing the city of Tsaritsyn. On February 7th, 1921, Conner would denounce the ruling regime and would proclaim the Connerian Union as Russia's one legitimate government, speaking a civil war between the Reds and Whites. By 1927, the Russian Civil War had been de facto won by the Red factions. Only a year later, however, Joseph Stalin attempted to coup Conner and secure power for himself. This plan would lead to the Connerian Union sueing for peace and allowing for the establishment of a rump Transcaucasian state led by Stalin, but leaves Conner in a perpetual state of paranoia over the possibility of another Stalinist coup. Early mass industrialization plans are instituted, which inevitably fail, until the Three Year Plan in 1934 shows some success. Not long after David's own Davesden Address, Conner would give his own national speech to the Union, addressing his desire to no longer dwell on the past, but rather to prepare the country for its great reclamation of the glory and prestige it'd lost."
leader_desc_haskell:0 "§HHaskell Wells Kirchubel§!\n\nHaskell began his political and military career by taking arguably the most extreme measure possible - deposing the French leadership in a coup and reigniting the French Civil War that had come to a ceasefire a decade prior. The cause of the conflict initially had been sudden death of Napoleon Bonaparte, and Haskell desired to emulate his successes during the Napoleonic Wars in order to reunify the Metropole. Like Napoleon, he'd quickly defeat his foes and would reunify France. A little less than two years later, in 1843, Haskell would announce elections to take place for the first time in years. He would secure his position of power by winning in a landslide victory, and would subsequently proclaim the Third French Republic. In 1852, Haskell's reign would be put to the test as that year saw the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, which initially saw French success in the Rhineland, but inevitably resulted in Prussian boots marching into the French countryside. Haskell is voted out of office as a result of this humiliating defeat. He'd later prove his capabilities once more by heroically defending his country at the outbreak of the Franco-German War in 1890. His defense of Paris and peace settlement restored unrivaled public support for him, earning him the Presidency once more, and leading to the formation of the Fourth French Republic.\n\nThe outbreak of the Schlimkrieg would prompt Haskell back to his military position, and he'd form a defensive line of the countryside at the Marne river, halting the German advance. Apart from the davastating Battle of Verdave, the lines would cement there for the duration of the war. The inevitable conclusion of the Schlimkrieg would guarantee France's position as the sole continental power, albeit with the loss of millions of French men, and many colonial holdings to regional uprisings. France's victory in the war allowed Haskell to win reelection in 1922, and from that point onwards he'd take a far more domestic approach as a measure to combat the issues that plagued the country post-war. The Great Davepression didn't aid this recovery by any means, despite the French economy having stabilized since then, but it only proved the future of France to be even more uncertain."
